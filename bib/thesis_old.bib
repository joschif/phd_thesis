	abstract = {Significance
            Using 3D culture of human ES cells, we show new self-organizing aspects of human corticogenesis: spontaneous development of intracortical polarity, curving morphology, and complex zone separations. Moreover, this culture generates species-specific progenitors, outer radial glia, which are abundantly present in the human, but not mouse, neocortex. Our study suggests an unexpectedly wide range of self-organizing events that are driven by internal programs in human neocortex development.
          , 
            Here, using further optimized 3D culture that allows highly selective induction and long-term growth of human ES cell (hESC)-derived cortical neuroepithelium, we demonstrate unique aspects of self-organization in human neocorticogenesis. Self-organized cortical tissue spontaneously forms a polarity along the dorsocaudal-ventrorostral axis and undergoes region-specific rolling morphogenesis that generates a semispherical structure. The neuroepithelium self-forms a multilayered structure including three neuronal zones (subplate, cortical plate, and Cajal-Retzius cell zones) and three progenitor zones (ventricular, subventricular, and intermediate zones) in the same apical-basal order as seen in the human fetal cortex in the early second trimester. In the cortical plate, late-born neurons tend to localize more basally to early-born neurons, consistent with the inside-out pattern seen in vivo. Furthermore, the outer subventricular zone contains basal progenitors that share characteristics with outer radial glia abundantly found in the human, but not mouse, fetal brain. Thus, human neocorticogenesis involves intrinsic programs that enable the emergence of complex neocortical features.},

To chart the regulatory activity underlying these events, we generated a map of accessible chromatin in human three-dimensional forebrain organoids.

Active chromatin regions identified in human primary brain tissue were observed in organoids at different developmental stages. We used this resource to map genetic risk for disease and to explore evolutionary conservation. Moreover, we integrated chromatin accessibility with transcriptomics to identify putative enhancer-gene linkages and transcription factors that regulate human corticogenesis. Overall, this platform brings insights into gene-regulatory dynamics at previously inaccessible stages of human forebrain development, including signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Hes1 is one of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that regulate mammalian CNS development, and its loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes indicate that it negatively regulates neuronal differentiation.Here we report that Hes1−/− mice expressed both early (TuJ1 and Hu) and late (MAP2 and Neurofilament) neuronal markers prematurely, and that there were approximately twice the normal number of neurons in theHes1−/− brain during early neural development. However, immunochemical analyses of sections and dissociated cells using neural progenitor markers, including nestin, failed to detect any changes in Hes1−/−progenitor population. Therefore, further characterization of neural progenitor cells that discriminated between multipotent and monopotent cells was performed using two culture methods, low-density culture, and a neurosphere assay. We demonstrate that the self-renewal activity of multipotent progenitor cells was reduced in theHes1−/− brain, and that their subsequent commitment to the neuronal lineage was accelerated. TheHes1−/− neuronal progenitor cells were functionally abnormal, in that they divided, on average, only once, and then generated two neurons, (instead of one progenitor cell and one neuron), whereas wild-type progenitor cells divided more. In addition, some Hes1−/− progenitors followed an apoptotic fate. The overproduction of neurons in the earlyHes1−/− brains may reflect this premature and immediate generation of neurons as well as a net increase in the number of neuronal progenitor cells.Taken together, we conclude that Hes1 is important for maintaining the self-renewing ability of progenitors and for repressing the commitment of multipotent progenitor cells to a neuronal fate, which is critical for the correct number of neurons to be produced and for the establishment of normal neuronal function.},

	volume = {129},
	abstract = {Considerable data suggest that sonic hedgehog (Shh) is both necessary and sufficient for the specification of ventral pattern throughout the nervous system, including the telencephalon. We show that the regional markers induced by Shh in the E9.0 telencephalon are dependent on the dorsoventral and anteroposterior position of ectopic Shh expression. This suggests that by this point in development regional character in the telencephalon is established. To determine whether this prepattern is dependent on earlier Shh signaling, we examined the telencephalon in mice carrying either Shh- or Gli3-null mutant alleles. This analysis revealed that the expression of a subset of ventral telencephalic markers, including Dlx2 and Gsh2, although greatly diminished, persist in Shh(-/-) mutants, and that these same markers were expanded in Gli3(-/-) mutants. To understand further the genetic interaction between Shh and Gli3, we examined Shh/Gli3 and Smoothened/Gli3 double homozygous mutants. Notably, in animals carrying either of these genetic backgrounds, genes such as Gsh2 and Dlx2, which are expressed pan-ventrally, as well as Nkx2.1, which demarcates the ventral most aspect of the telencephalon, appear to be largely restored to their wild-type patterns of expression. These results suggest that normal patterning in the telencephalon depends on the ventral repression of Gli3 function by Shh and, conversely, on the dorsal repression of Shh signaling by Gli3. In addition these results support the idea that, in addition to hedgehog signaling, a Shh-independent pathways must act during development to pattern the telencephalon.},

In contrast to other repositories, our database takes into account the subunit architecture of both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. We integrated our resource with a statistical framework that predicts enriched cellular interactions between two cell types from single-cell transcriptomics data. Here, we outline the structure and content of our repository, provide procedures for inferring cell-cell communication networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data and present a practical step-by-step guide to help implement the protocol.

CellPhoneDB v.2.0 is publicly available, both as code and as a user-friendly web interface; it can be used by both experts and researchers with little experience in computational genomics. In our protocol, we demonstrate how to evaluate meaningful biological interactions with CellPhoneDB v.2.0 using published datasets.

Neurons induced in explants derived from both diencephalic and telencephalic levels of the neural plate express the LIM homeodomain protein Isl-1, and these neurons possess distinct identities that match those of the ventral neurons generated in these two subdivisions of the forebrain in vivo.

	abstract = {Lipids in avocados have been widely studied due to their nutritional value and several reported bioactivities. Aliphatic acetogenins are a relevant component of the avocado lipidome and have been tested for several potential food and pharma industries applications. This work followed the evolution of avocado fatty acids (FAs) and aliphatic acetogenins during seed germination and leaf growth. Oil extracts of embryonic axes, cotyledons, and leaves from seedlings and trees were divided to analyze free acetylated acetogenins (AcO-acetogenins), and free FAs. Embryonic axes from germinating seeds contained the highest amount of AcO-acetogenins and FAs; this tissue also accumulated the most diverse FA profile with up to 22 detected moieties. Leaves presented the highest variations in AcO-acetogenin profiles during development, although leaves from seedlings accumulated the simplest FA profile with only 10 different FAs. Remarkably, AcO-acetogenins represented half of the carbons allocated to lipids in grown leaves, while embryonic axes and cotyledons always contained more carbons within FAs during germination. Thus, we hypothesized the use of the AcO-acetogenin acyl chain for energy production toward β-oxidation. Also, α-linolenic and docosahexaenoic acids (DHAs) were proposed as close AcO-acetogenin intermediaries based on a correlation network generated using all these data. Another part of the oil extract was fractionated into different lipid classes before transesterification to profile FAs and acetogenins bound to lipids. Acetogenin backbones were identified for the first time in triglycerides from cotyledons and mainly in polar lipids (which include phospholipids) in all developing avocado tissues analyzed. Seed tissues accumulated preferentially polar lipids during germination, while triglycerides were consumed in cotyledons. Seedling leaves contained minute amounts of triglycerides, and polar lipids increased as they developed. Results from this work suggest acetogenins might be part of the energy and signaling metabolisms, and possibly of membrane structures, underlining the yet to establish role(s) of these unusual lipids in the avocado plant physiology.},

The molecular information on its development, however, has been relatively poor. To date, only Emx genes were known to be required for dorsal telencephalon development. Here, we report on forebrain development in the extra toes (Xt(J)) mouse mutant which carries a null mutation of the Gli3 gene. This defect leads to a failure to establish the dorsal di-telencephalic junction and finally results in a severe size reduction of the neocortex. In addition, Xt(J)/Xt(J) mice show absence of the hippocampus (Ammon's horn plus dentate gyrus) and the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle. The medial wall of the telencephalon, which gives rise to these structures, fails to invaginate during embryonic development. On a molecular level, disruption of dorsal telencephalon development in Xt(J)/Xt(J) embryos correlates with a loss of Emx1 and Emx2 expression. Furthermore, the expression of Fgf8 and Bmp4 in the dorsal midline of the telencephalon is altered. However, expression of Shh, which is negatively regulated by Gli3 in the spinal cord, is not affected in the Xt(J)/Xt(J) forebrain. This study therefore implicates Gli3 as a key regulator for the development of the dorsal telencephalon and implies Gli3 to be upstream of Emx genes in a genetic cascade controlling dorsal telencephalic development.},

Clearing and subsequent 3D reconstruction of entire organoids reveal that many of these regions are interconnected, suggesting that the entire range of dorso-ventral identities can be generated within continuous neuroepithelia. Consistent with this, we demonstrate the presence of forebrain organizing centers that express secreted growth factors, which may be involved in dorso-ventral patterning within organoids. Furthermore, we demonstrate the timed generation of neurons with mature morphologies, as well as the subsequent generation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.

In this review, we first present the specific temporal patterns of expression of the E2F and Rb family members during CNS development and then discuss the genetic ablation of single or multiple members of these two families. Overall, the available data suggest a time-dependent and cell-context specific role of E2F and Rb family members in the developing and adult CNS.},

Although the role of Gli3 in embryonic patterning has been extensively studied, its role in cortical neurogenesis, especially in the regulation of neural progenitors in proliferation and cell fate specification, is largely unknown. To bypass the patterning defects caused by loss of Gli3, we conditionally deleted Gli3 after patterning was complete in mouse. Our results from birthdating and in utero electroporation experiments demonstrate that the Gli3, specifically Gli3R, is critical for specifying the fate of cortical neurons that are generated following a stereotypical temporal order. Moreover, Gli3 is required for maintaining the cortical progenitors in active cell cycle, suggesting that cells may acquire differentiated status as they turn off Gli3 expression during neurogenesis.},

Here we use a systematic approach including defined monolayer culture, signaling modulation, and single-cell gene expression analysis to delineate a developmental trajectory for human otic lineage specification in vitro. We found that modulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and WNT signaling combined with FGF and retinoic acid treatments over the course of 18 days generates cell populations that develop chronological expression of marker genes of non-neural ectoderm, preplacodal ectoderm, and early otic lineage. Gene expression along this differentiation path is distinct from other lineages such as endoderm, mesendoderm, and neural ectoderm. Single-cell analysis exposed the heterogeneity of differentiating cells and allowed discrimination of non-neural ectoderm and otic lineage cells from off-target populations. Pseudotemporal ordering of human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived single-cell gene expression profiles revealed an initially synchronous guidance toward non-neural ectoderm, followed by comparatively asynchronous occurrences of preplacodal and otic marker genes. Positive correlation of marker gene expression between both cell lines and resemblance to mouse embryonic day 10.5 otocyst cells implied reasonable robustness of the guidance protocol. Single-cell trajectory analysis further revealed that otic progenitor cell types are induced in monolayer cultures, but further development appears impeded, likely because of lack of a lineage-stabilizing microenvironment. Our results provide a framework for future exploration of stabilizing microenvironments for efficient differentiation of stem cell-generated human otic cell types.},

	abstract = {The Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) is a pleiotropic, multiple congenital anomaly syndrome. It is rare, but precise estimates of incidence are difficult to determine, as ascertainment is erratic (estimated range 1-9/1,000,000). The primary findings include hypertelorism, macrocephaly with frontal bossing, and polysyndactyly. The polydactyly is most commonly preaxial of the feet and postaxial in the hands, with variable cutaneous syndactyly, but the limb findings vary significantly. Other low frequency findings include central nervous system (CNS) anomalies, hernias, and cognitive impairment. GCPS is caused by loss of function mutations in the GLI3 transcription factor gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The disorder is allelic to the Pallister-Hall syndrome and one form of the acrocallosal syndrome. Clinical diagnosis is challenging because the findings of GCPS are relatively non-specific, and no specific and sensitive clinical have been delineated. For this reason, we have proposed a combined clinical-molecular definition for the syndrome. A presumptive diagnosis of GCPS can be made if the patient has the classic triad of preaxial polydactyly with cutaneous syndactyly of at least one limb, hypertelorism, and macrocephaly. Patients with a phenotype consistent with GCPS (but which may not manifest all three attributes listed above) and a GLI3 mutation may be diagnosed definitively with GCPS. In addition, persons with a GCPS-consistent phenotype who are related to a definitively diagnosed family member in a pattern consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance may be diagnosed definitively as well. Antenatal molecular diagnosis is technically straightforward to perform. Differential diagnoses include preaxial polydactyly type 4, the GCPS contiguous gene syndrome, acrocallosal syndrome, Gorlin syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, and Teebi syndrome. Treatment of the disorder is symptomatic, with plastic or orthopedic surgery indicated for significant limb malformations. The prognosis for typically affected patients is excellent. There may be a slight increase in the incidence of developmental delay or cognitive impairment. Patients with large deletions that include GLI3 may have a worse prognosis.

	volume = {27},
	abstract = {Division of the telencephalic vesicle into hemispheres and specification of the cerebral cortex are key stages in forebrain development. We investigate the interplay in these processes of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs), and the transcription factor Gli3, which in its repressor form (Gli3R) antagonizes Shh signaling and downregulates expression of several Fgf genes. Contrary to previous reports, Shh is not required for dorsal hemisphere separation. Mice lacking Shh develop a dorsal telencephalic midline, a cortical hem, and two cortical hemispheres. The hemispheres do not divide rostrally, probably because of reduced local Fgf gene expression, resulting from the loss of Shh inhibition of Gli3R. Removing one functional copy of Gli3 substantially rescues Fgf expression and rostral telencephalic morphology. In mice lacking Gli3 function, cortical development is arrested, and ventral gene expression invades the dorsal telencephalon. These defects are potentially explained by disinhibition of Shh activity. However, when both copies of Shh are removed from Gli3-null mice, dorsal telencephalic defects persist. One such defect is a large dorsal expansion of the expression of Fgf genes. Fgf15 expression, for example, expands from a discrete ventral domain throughout the dorsal telencephalon. We propose that Fgf signaling, known to ventralize the telencephalon in a Shh-independent manner, suppresses cortical fate in the absence of Gli3. Our findings point away from Shh involvement in dorsal telencephalic patterning and encourage additional exploration of Fgf signaling and Gli3 repression in corticogenesis.},

Our results show that human cerebral organoids reproduce the cortical heterotopia associated with PH. Mutations in DCHS1 and FAT4 or knockdown of their expression causes changes in the morphology of neural progenitor cells and result in defective neuronal migration dynamics only in a subset of neurons. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data reveal a subpopulation of mutant neurons with dysregulated genes involved in axon guidance, neuronal migration and patterning.

Anterior-posterior SHH/GLI3 signaling gradients regulate cell cycle factors controlling mesenchymal cell proliferation, while simultaneously regulating Grem1 to coordinate BMP-induced chondrogenesis. SHH/GLI3 also coordinates the expression of additional genes, however their importance in digit formation remain unknown. Utilizing genetic and molecular approaches, we identified HES1 as a key transcriptional regulator downstream of SHH/GLI signaling capable of inducing preaxial polydactyly (PPD), required for Gli3-deficient PPD, and capable of overcoming digit number constraints of Shh-deficiency. Our data indicate that HES1, a direct SHH/GLI signaling target, induces mesenchymal cell proliferation via suppression of Cdkn1b, while inhibiting chondrogenic genes and the anterior autopod boundary regulator, Pax9. These findings fill gaps in knowledge regarding digit number and patterning, while creating a comprehensive framework for our molecular understanding of critical mediators of SHH/GLI3 signaling.},

Because NHEJ is more efficient than HDR, the frequency with which precise genome editing can be achieved is so low that simultaneous editing of more than one gene has hitherto not been possible. Here, we introduced a mutation in the human PRKDC gene that eliminates the kinase activity of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). This results in an increase in HDR irrespective of cell type and CRISPR enzyme used, sometimes allowing 87\% of chromosomes in a population of cells to be precisely edited. It also allows for precise editing of up to four genes simultaneously (8 chromosomes) in the same cell. Transient inhibition of DNA-PKcs by the kinase inhibitor M3814 is similarly able to enhance precise genome editing.},

However, the genetic and developmental programs that underlie this divergence are not fully understood. Here we have analysed stem cell-derived cerebral organoids using single-cell transcriptomics and accessible chromatin profiling to investigate gene-regulatory changes that are specific to humans. We first analysed cell composition and reconstructed differentiation trajectories over the entire course of human cerebral organoid development from pluripotency, through neuroectoderm and neuroepithelial stages, followed by divergence into neuronal fates within the dorsal and ventral forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain regions. Brain-region composition varied in organoids from different iPSC lines, but regional gene-expression patterns remained largely reproducible across individuals. We analysed chimpanzee and macaque cerebral organoids and found that human neuronal development occurs at a slower pace relative to the other two primates. Using pseudotemporal alignment of differentiation paths, we found that human-specific gene expression resolved to distinct cell states along progenitor-to-neuron lineages in the cortex. Chromatin accessibility was dynamic during cortex development, and we identified divergence in accessibility between human and chimpanzee that correlated with human-specific gene expression and genetic change. Finally, we mapped human-specific expression in adult prefrontal cortex using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis and identified developmental differences that persist into adulthood, as well as cell-state-specific changes that occur exclusively in the adult brain. Our data provide a temporal cell atlas of great ape forebrain development, and illuminate dynamic gene-regulatory features that are unique to humans.

The homozygous variant in patients was inherited from carrier parents with normal phenotypes, indicating a likely recessive genetic model. Given that the HES1 gene is predicted to be likely to exhibit haploinsufficiency (\%HI: 11.44), we hypothesized that the HES1 homozygous variant is a genetic risk factor underlying CHD. We then carried out sequencing of this HES1 variant in 629 sporadic nonsyndromic CHD cases and 696 healthy controls and performed association analysis. Interestingly, we observed a significant association of the homozygous HES1 promoter variant with CHD (18.92\% of cases vs 9.91\% of controls; OR: 2.291, 95\% CI: 1.637-3.207, p=9.72\${\textbackslash}times\$10-7). No significant association with CHD was observed for the HES1 promoter heterozygous variant (p{\textgreater}0.05). However, association analysis tests of the HES1 homozygous variant with each subtype of CHD revealed that this homozygous variant was strongly associated with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) (OR: 3.726, 95\% CI: 1.745-7.956, p=0.0003). Moreover, the prevalence of HES1 homozygous variants in CHD patients with TGA (27.66\%) was significantly higher than that in patients with other CHD subtypes or controls. Similar results were observed in a replication group of TGA (n=64). Functional studies demonstrated that the homozygous variant in the HES1 promoter can disrupt its ability to bind RXRA, an inhibitory transcription factor, which results in abnormally high expression of the HES1 gene, indicating that this variant harbors gain-of-function effects. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that the noncoding homozygous variant in the HES1 promoter has a gain-of-function effect and is associated with an increased risk of CHD development, especially the severe TGA},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3\%-8\% of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37\%-53\%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18\%-37\%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47\%-68\%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure.},

It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell's position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per cell are sufficient to assign 97\% of singlets and identify 92\% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of {\textgreater}99\% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. We apply demuxlet to assess cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in 8 pooled lupus patient samples treated with interferon (IFN)-β and perform eQTL analysis on 23 pooled samples.},

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {Many chromatin features play critical roles in regulating gene expression. A complete understanding of gene regulation will require the mapping of specific chromatin features in small samples of cells at high resolution. Here we describe Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT\&Tag), an enzyme-tethering strategy that provides efficient high-resolution sequencing libraries for profiling diverse chromatin components. In CUT\&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low background. All steps from live cells to sequencing-ready libraries can be performed in a single tube on the benchtop or a microwell in a high-throughput pipeline, and the entire procedure can be performed in one day. We demonstrate the utility of CUT\&Tag by profiling histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors on low cell numbers and single cells.},

Here we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived three-dimensional organoid culture system, termed cerebral organoids, that develop various discrete, although interdependent, brain regions. These include a cerebral cortex containing progenitor populations that organize and produce mature cortical neuron subtypes. Furthermore, cerebral organoids are shown to recapitulate features of human cortical development, namely characteristic progenitor zone organization with abundant outer radial glial stem cells. Finally, we use RNA interference and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells to model microcephaly, a disorder that has been difficult to recapitulate in mice. We demonstrate premature neuronal differentiation in patient organoids, a defect that could help to explain the disease phenotype. Together, these data show that three-dimensional organoids can recapitulate development and disease even in this most complex human tissue.},

	title = {{SCIM}: universal single-cell matching with unpaired feature sets},
	volume = {36},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recent technological advances have led to an increase in the production and availability of single-cell data. The ability to integrate a set of multi-technology measurements would allow the identification of biologically or clinically meaningful observations through the unification of the perspectives afforded by each technology. In most cases, however, profiling technologies consume the used cells and thus pairwise correspondences between datasets are lost. Due to the sheer size single-cell datasets can acquire, scalable algorithms that are able to universally match single-cell measurements carried out in one cell to its corresponding sibling in another technology are needed. RESULTS: We propose Single-Cell data Integration via Matching (SCIM), a scalable approach to recover such correspondences in two or more technologies. SCIM assumes that cells share a common (low-dimensional) underlying structure and that the underlying cell distribution is approximately constant across technologies. It constructs a technology-invariant latent space using an autoencoder framework with an adversarial objective. Multi-modal datasets are integrated by pairing cells across technologies using a bipartite matching scheme that operates on the low-dimensional latent representations. We evaluate SCIM on a simulated cellular branching process and show that the cell-to-cell matches derived by SCIM reflect the same pseudotime on the simulated dataset. Moreover, we apply our method to two real-world scenarios, a melanoma tumor sample and a human bone marrow sample, where we pair cells from a scRNA dataset to their sibling cells in a CyTOF dataset achieving 90\% and 78\% cell-matching accuracy for each one of the samples, respectively.

We further demonstrate efficient one-step generation of double- and triple-gene knockout hPSC lines, as well as stage-specific inducible gene knockout during hPSC differentiation.

            Neuronal cultures are very valuable to learn about basic principles of the nervous system. In vivo, neural electrical activity is the essence of nervous system function, controlling emotion, memory, sensory modalities, and behavior. In this study, we discovered that many crucial neurophysiological properties were strongly altered in classic culture media that are widely used by the research community. To overcome this problem, we designed and tested a new tissue culture neuromedium that adequately supports in vitro neuronal activity. The improvements made in this medium reduce the gap between in vivo brain physiological conditions and neuronal models in vitro. Improving physiological conditions in vitro may lead to more successful translation from bench to clinics.
          , 
            Human cell reprogramming technologies offer access to live human neurons from patients and provide a new alternative for modeling neurological disorders in vitro. Neural electrical activity is the essence of nervous system function in vivo. Therefore, we examined neuronal activity in media widely used to culture neurons. We found that classic basal media, as well as serum, impair action potential generation and synaptic communication. To overcome this problem, we designed a new neuronal medium (BrainPhys basal + serum-free supplements) in which we adjusted the concentrations of inorganic salts, neuroactive amino acids, and energetic substrates. We then tested that this medium adequately supports neuronal activity and survival of human neurons in culture. Long-term exposure to this physiological medium also improved the proportion of neurons that were synaptically active. The medium was designed to culture human neurons but also proved adequate for rodent neurons. The improvement in BrainPhys basal medium to support neurophysiological activity is an important step toward reducing the gap between brain physiological conditions in vivo and neuronal models in vitro.},

	abstract = {The efficient generation of striatal neurons from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is fundamental for realising their promise in disease modelling, pharmaceutical drug screening and cell therapy for Huntington's disease. GABAergic medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) are the principal projection neurons of the striatum and specifically degenerate in the early phase of Huntington's disease. Here we report that activin A induces lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) characteristics in nascent neural progenitors derived from hESCs and hiPSCs in a sonic hedgehog-independent manner. Correct specification of striatal phenotype was further demonstrated by the induction of the striatal transcription factors CTIP2, GSX2 and FOXP2. Crucially, these human LGE progenitors readily differentiate into postmitotic neurons expressing the striatal projection neuron signature marker DARPP32, both in culture and following transplantation in the adult striatum in a rat model of Huntington's disease. Activin-induced neurons also exhibit appropriate striatal-like electrophysiology in vitro. Together, our findings demonstrate a novel route for efficient differentiation of GABAergic striatal MSNs from human pluripotent stem cells.},

While the chordamesoderm is a well-known source of ventralizing signals, relatively little is known about the cues that induce dorsal cell types, including neural crest. Here, we demonstrate that juxtaposition of the non-neural and neural ectoderm is sufficient to induce the expression of dorsal markers, Wnt-1, Wnt-3a and Slug, as well as the formation of neural crest cells. In addition, the competence of neural plate to express Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a appears to be stage dependent, occurring only when neural tissue is taken from stage 8–10 embryos but not from stage 4 embryos, regardless of the age of the non-neural ectoderm. In contrast to the induction of Wnt gene expression, neural crest cell formation and Slug expression can be induced when either stage 4 or stage 8–10 neural plates are placed in contact with the non-neural ectoderm. These data suggest that the non-neural ectoderm provides a signal (or signals) that specifies dorsal cell types within the neural tube, and that the response is dependent on the competence of the neural tissue.},

Thus we asked whether Wnt factors are involved in patterning of the nervous system along this axis. We show that Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a, both of which are expressed in the dorsal portion of the neural tube, could synergize with the neural inducers noggin and chordin in
              Xenopus
              animal explants to generate the most dorsal neural structure, the neural crest, as determined by the expression of

              Krox-20
              remained unaffected. Enlargement in the neural crest population could occur even when cell proliferation was inhibited. Wnt-5A and Wnt-8, neither of which is expressed in the dorsal neuroectoderm, failed to induce neural crest markers. Overexpression of glycogen synthase kinase 3, known to antagonize Wnt signaling, blocked the neural-crest-inducing activity of Wnt-3a in animal explants and inhibited neural crest formation in whole embryos. We suggest that Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a have a role in patterning the neural tube along its dorsoventral axis and function in the differentiation of the neural crest.},

            Organoids enable disease modeling in complex and structured human tissue,
            in vitro
            . Like most 3D models, they lack sufficient oxygen supply, leading to cellular stress. These negative effects are particularly prominent in complex models, like brain organoids, where they can prevent proper lineage commitment. Here, we analyze brain organoid and fetal single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from published and new datasets totaling over 190,000 cells. We describe a unique stress signature found in all organoid samples, but not in fetal samples. We demonstrate that cell stress is limited to a defined organoid cell population, and present Gruffi, an algorithm that uses granular functional filtering to identify and remove stressed cells from any organoid scRNAseq dataset in an unbiased manner. Our data show that adverse effects of cell stress can be corrected by bioinformatic analysis, improving developmental trajectories and resemblance to fetal data.},

              et al.
              now add another layer of information and complexity by combining single-cell transcriptomics with oligo hashing and small molecule screening in a method called sci-Plex. Because screening many chemical compounds requires the ability to profile many cells, and because screens perturb cells in many different ways, the authors demonstrate the effects of 188 compounds in three cancer lines. The sci-Plex method can capture gene expression profiles from thousands of experimental conditions in a single experiment.

            A technique termed sci-Plex can screen the effects of multiple chemical treatments on gene expression in single cells.
          , 
            High-throughput chemical screens typically use coarse assays such as cell survival, limiting what can be learned about mechanisms of action, off-target effects, and heterogeneous responses. Here, we introduce “sci-Plex,” which uses “nuclear hashing” to quantify global transcriptional responses to thousands of independent perturbations at single-cell resolution. As a proof of concept, we applied sci-Plex to screen three cancer cell lines exposed to 188 compounds. In total, we profiled {\textasciitilde}650,000 single-cell transcriptomes across {\textasciitilde}5000 independent samples in one experiment. Our results reveal substantial intercellular heterogeneity in response to specific compounds, commonalities in response to families of compounds, and insight into differential properties within families. In particular, our results with histone deacetylase inhibitors support the view that chromatin acts as an important reservoir of acetate in cancer cells.},

            Mapping cell types in the human body
            The Tabula Sapiens is a molecular reference atlas for more than 400 cell types of the human body. The Tabula Sapiens Consortium used single-cell transcriptomics to measure the messenger RNA molecules in each of nearly 500,000 cells from 24 tissues and organs (see the Perspective by Liu and Zhang). These data enable new insights into how the human genome parts list is used to create distinct cell types within the human organism. In addition to creating a detailed molecular definition of these cell types, the atlas reveals many other aspects of human biology, including how the same gene can be spliced differently in different cell types, how shared cell types in different tissues can have subtle differences in their identities, and how clones of the immune system can be shared across tissues. —LZ and DJ

            Single-cell transcriptomics provides a molecularly defined phenotypic reference of human cell types that spans 24 human tissues and organs.

              INTRODUCTION
              Although the genome is often called the blueprint of an organism, it is perhaps more accurate to describe it as a parts list composed of the various genes that may or may not be used in the different cell types of a multicellular organism. Although nearly every cell in the body has essentially the same genome, each cell type makes different use of that genome and expresses a subset of all possible genes. This has motivated efforts to characterize the molecular composition of various cell types within humans and multiple model organisms, both by transcriptional and proteomic approaches. We created a human reference atlas comprising nearly 500,000 cells from 24 different tissues and organs, many from the same donor. This atlas enabled molecular characterization of more than 400 cell types, their distribution across tissues, and tissue-specific variation in gene expression.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              One caveat to current approaches to make cell atlases is that individual organs are often collected at different locations, collected from different donors, and processed using different protocols. Controlled comparisons of cell types between different tissues and organs are especially difficult when donors differ in genetic background, age, environmental exposure, and epigenetic effects. To address this, we developed an approach to analyzing large numbers of organs from the same individual.
            
            
              RESULTS
              We collected multiple tissues from individual human donors and performed coordinated single-cell transcriptome analyses on live cells. The donors come from a range of ethnicities, are balanced by gender, have a mean age of 51 years, and have a variety of medical backgrounds. Tissue experts used a defined cell ontology terminology to annotate cell types consistently across the different tissues, leading to a total of 475 distinct cell types with reference transcriptome profiles. The full dataset can be explored online with the cellxgene tool.
              Data were collected for the bladder, blood, bone marrow, eye, fat, heart, kidney, large intestine, liver, lung, lymph node, mammary, muscle, pancreas, prostate, salivary gland, skin, small intestine, spleen, thymus, tongue, trachea, uterus, and vasculature. Fifty-nine separate specimens in total were collected, processed, and analyzed, and 483,152 cells passed quality control filtering. On a per-compartment basis, the dataset includes 264,824 immune cells, 104,148 epithelial cells, 31,691 endothelial cells, and 82,478 stromal cells. Working with live cells, as opposed to isolated nuclei, ensured that the dataset includes all mRNA transcripts within the cell, including transcripts that have been processed by the cell’s splicing machinery, thereby enabling insight into variation in alternative splicing.
              
                The Tabula Sapiens also provided an opportunity to densely and directly sample the human microbiome throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The intestines from two donors were sectioned into five regions: the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and ascending and sigmoid colon. Each section was transected, and three to nine samples were collected from each location, followed by amplification and sequencing of the 16
                S
                ribosomal RNA gene.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              The Tabula Sapiens has revealed discoveries relating to shared behavior and subtle, organ-specific differences across cell types. We found T cell clones shared between organs and characterized organ-dependent hypermutation rates among B cells. Endothelial cells and macrophages are shared across tissues, often showing subtle but clear differences in gene expression. We found an unexpectedly large and diverse amount of cell type–specific RNA splice variant usage and discovered and validated many previously undefined splices. The intestinal microbiome was revealed to have nonuniform species distributions down to the 3-inch (7.62-cm) length scale. These are but a few examples of how the Tabula Sapiens represents a broadly useful reference to deeply understand and explore human biology at cellular resolution.

              Computational trajectory inference enables the reconstruction of cell state dynamics from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. However, trajectory inference requires that the direction of a biological process is known, largely limiting its application to differentiating systems in normal development. Here, we present CellRank (
              https://cellrank.org
              ) for single-cell fate mapping in diverse scenarios, including regeneration, reprogramming and disease, for which direction is unknown. Our approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, taking into account the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in velocity vectors. On pancreas development data, CellRank automatically detects initial, intermediate and terminal populations, predicts fate potentials and visualizes continuous gene expression trends along individual lineages. Applied to lineage-traced cellular reprogramming data, predicted fate probabilities correctly recover reprogramming outcomes. CellRank also predicts a new dedifferentiation trajectory during postinjury lung regeneration, including previously unknown intermediate cell states, which we confirm experimentally.},

              at the L2 larval stage, which provided {\textgreater}50-fold “shotgun” cellular coverage of its somatic cell composition. From these data, we defined consensus expression profiles for 27 cell types and recovered rare neuronal cell types corresponding to as few as one or two cells in the L2 worm. We integrated these profiles with whole-animal chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data to deconvolve the cell type–specific effects of transcription factors. The data generated by sci-RNA-seq constitute a powerful resource for nematode biology and foreshadow similar atlases for other organisms.},

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

Single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves—all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology, and disease.},

          , 
            Technical advances have enabled the collection of genome and transcriptome data sets with single-cell resolution. However, single-cell characterization of the epigenome has remained challenging. Furthermore, because cells must be physically separated before biochemical processing, conventional single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly. We applied combinatorial cellular indexing to measure chromatin accessibility in thousands of single cells per assay, circumventing the need for compartmentalization of individual cells. We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas.},

            Single-cell atlases often include samples that span locations, laboratories and conditions, leading to complex, nested batch effects in data. Thus, joint analysis of atlas datasets requires reliable data integration. To guide integration method choice, we benchmarked 68 method and preprocessing combinations on 85 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and simulation data from 23 publications, altogether representing {\textgreater}1.2 million cells distributed in 13 atlas-level integration tasks. We evaluated methods according to scalability, usability and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation using 14 evaluation metrics. We show that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, scANVI, Scanorama, scVI and scGen perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks, while single-cell ATAC-sequencing integration performance is strongly affected by choice of feature space. Our freely available Python module and benchmarking pipeline can identify optimal data integration methods for new data, benchmark new methods and improve method development.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Probing epigenomic marks such as histone modifications at a single cell level in thousands of cells has been recently enabled by technologies such as scCUT\&Tag. Here we developed a multimodal and optimized iteration of scCUT\&Tag called nano-CT (for nano-CUT\&Tag) that allows simultaneous probing of three epigenomic modalities at single-cell resolution, using nanobody-Tn5 fusion proteins. nano-CT is compatible with starting materials as low as 25 000 cells and has significantly higher resolution than scCUT\&Tag, with a 16-fold increase in the number of fragments per cells. We used nano-CT to simultaneously profile chromatin accessibility, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 in a complex tissue - juvenile mouse brain. The obtained multimodal dataset allowed for discrimination of more cell types/states that scCUT\&Tag, and inference of chromatin velocity between ATAC and H3K27ac in the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage. In addition, we used nano-CT to deconvolute H3K27me3 repressive states and infer two sequential waves of H3K27me3 repression at distinct gene modules during OL lineage progression. Thus, given its high resolution, versatility, and multimodal features, nano-CT allows unique insights in epigenetic landscapes in different biological systems at single cell level.},

            Here, we present CellOracle, a computational tool that integrates single-cell transcriptome and epigenome profiles to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs), critical regulators of cell identity. Leveraging inferred GRNs, we simulate gene expression changes in response to transcription factor (TF) perturbation, enabling network configurations to be interrogated
            in silico
            , facilitating their interpretation. We validate the efficacy of CellOracle to recapitulate known regulatory changes across hematopoiesis, correctly predicting the outcomes of well-characterized TF perturbations. Integrating CellOracle analysis with lineage tracing of direct reprogramming reveals distinct network configurations underlying different reprogramming failure modes. Furthermore, analysis of GRN reconfiguration along successful reprogramming trajectories identifies new factors to enhance target cell yield, uncovering a role for the AP-1 subunit Fos, with the hippo signaling effector, Yap1. Together, these results demonstrate the efficacy of CellOracle to infer and interpret cell-type-specific GRN configurations, at high-resolution, promoting new mechanistic insights into the regulation and reprogramming of cell identity.},

              INTRODUCTION
              Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes consist of multiple specialized subtypes that play a central role in pathogen sensing, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully understood, as these populations have historically been defined by a combination of morphology, physical properties, localization, functions, developmental origins, and expression of a restricted set of surface markers.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              
                To overcome this inherently biased strategy for cell identification, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of {\textasciitilde}2400 cells isolated from healthy blood donors and enriched for HLA-DR
                +
                lineage
                −
                cells. This single-cell profiling strategy and unbiased genomic classification, together with follow-up profiling and functional and phenotypic characterization of prospectively isolated subsets, led us to identify and validate six DC subtypes and four monocyte subtypes, and thus revise the taxonomy of these cells.
              
            
            
              RESULTS
              Our study reveals:
              
                1) A new DC subset, representing 2 to 3\% of the DC populations across all 10 donors tested, characterized by the expression of
                AXL
                ,
                SIGLEC1
                , and
                SIGLEC6
                antigens, named AS DCs. The AS DC population further divides into two populations captured in the traditionally defined plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and CD1C
                +
                conventional DC (cDC) gates. This split is further reflected through AS DC gene expression signatures spanning a spectrum between cDC-like and pDC-like gene sets. Although AS DCs share properties with pDCs, they more potently activate T cells. This discovery led us to reclassify pDCs as the originally described “natural interferon-producing cells (IPCs)” with weaker T cell proliferation induction ability.
              
              
                2) A new subdivision within the CD1C
                +
                DC subset: one defined by a major histocompatibility complex class II–like gene set and one by a CD14
                +
                monocyte–like prominent gene set. These CD1C
                +
                DC subsets, which can be enriched by combining CD1C with CD32B, CD36, and CD163 antigens, can both potently induce T cell proliferation.
              
              
                3) The existence of a circulating and dividing cDC progenitor giving rise to CD1C
                +
                and CLEC9A
                +
                DCs through in vitro differentiation assays. This blood precursor is defined by the expression of CD100
                +
                CD34
                int
                and observed at a frequency of {\textasciitilde}0.02\% of the LIN
                –
                HLA-DR
                +
                fraction.
              
              4) Two additional monocyte populations: one expressing classical monocyte genes and cytotoxic genes, and the other with unknown functions.
              5) Evidence for a relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia (BPDCN) cells and healthy DCs.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Our revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease. The discovery of AS DCs within the traditionally defined pDC population explains many of the cDC properties previously assigned to pDCs, highlighting the need to revisit the definition of pDCs. Furthermore, the discovery of blood cDC progenitors represents a new therapeutic target readily accessible in the bloodstream for manipulation, as well as a new source for better in vitro DC generation. Although the current results focus on DCs and monocytes, a similar strategy can be applied to build a comprehensive human immune cell atlas.

This strategy, together with follow-up profiling and functional and phenotypic characterization, led us to update the original cell classification to include six DCs, four monocyte subtypes, and one conventional DC progenitor.

This conservation implies that the coexpression of these gene pairs confers a selective advantage and therefore that these genes are functionally related. Manyof these relationships provide strong evidence for the involvement of new genes in core biological functions such as the cell cycle, secretion, and protein expression. We experimentallyconfirmed the predictions implied bysome of these links and identified cell proliferation functions for several genes. By assembling these links into a gene-coexpression network, we found several components that were animal-specific as well as interrelationships between newly evolved and ancient modules.},

Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptome atlas of mouse brain development spanning from gastrulation to birth. We identified almost a thousand distinct cellular states, including the initial emergence of the neuroepithelium, a rich set of region-specific secondary organizers and a complete developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes. We used the atlas to directly test the hypothesis that human glioblastoma reflects a return to a developmental cell state. In agreement, most aneuploid tumor cells matched embryonic rather than adult types, while karyotypically normal cells predominantly matched adult immune cell types.},

	abstract = {The prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e., TF regulon) is becoming a widely used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and data sets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are (1) manually curated repositories, (2) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (3) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (4) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression data sets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations and, thereby, downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark data sets. We assembled a collection of TF–target interactions for 1541 human TFs and evaluated how different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities, or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF–target interactions derived through these strategies, with confidence scores, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.},

	abstract = {Organoids generated from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) provide experimental systems to study development and disease. However, we lack quantitative spatiotemporal descriptions of organoid development that incorporate measurements across different molecular modalities. Here we focus on the retina and use a single-cell multimodal approach to reconstruct human retinal organoid development. We establish an experimental and computational pipeline to generate multiplexed spatial protein maps over a retinal organoid time course and primary adult human retina, registering protein expression features at the population, cellular, and subcellular levels. We develop an analytical toolkit to segment nuclei, identify local and global tissue units, infer morphology trajectories, and analyze cell neighborhoods from multiplexed imaging data. We use this toolkit to visualize progenitor and neuron location, the spatial arrangements of extracellular and subcellular components, and global patterning in each organoid and primary tissue. In addition, we generate a single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility time course dataset and infer a gene regulatory network underlying organoid development. We then integrate genomic data with spatially segmented nuclei into a multi-modal atlas enabling virtual exploration of retinal organoid development. We visualize molecular, cellular, and regulatory dynamics during organoid lamination, and identify regulons associated with neuronal differentiation and maintenance. We use the integrated atlas to explore retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spatial neighborhoods, highlighting pathways involved in RGC cell death. Finally, we show that mosaic CRISPR/Cas genetic perturbations in retinal organoids provide insight into cell fate regulation. Altogether, our work is a major advance toward a virtual human retinal organoid, and provides new directions for how to approach disorders of the visual system. More broadly, our approaches can be adapted to many organoid systems.},

              Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived organoids provide models to study human organ development. Single-cell transcriptomics enable highly resolved descriptions of cell states within these systems; however, approaches are needed to directly measure lineage relationships. Here we establish iTracer, a lineage recorder that combines reporter barcodes with inducible CRISPR–Cas9 scarring and is compatible with single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. We apply iTracer to explore clonality and lineage dynamics during cerebral organoid development and identify a time window of fate restriction as well as variation in neurogenic dynamics between progenitor neuron families. We also establish long-term four-dimensional light-sheet microscopy for spatial lineage recording in cerebral organoids and confirm regional clonality in the developing neuroepithelium. We incorporate gene perturbation (iTracer-perturb) and assess the effect of mosaic
              TSC2
              mutations on cerebral organoid development. Our data shed light on how lineages and fates are established during cerebral organoid formation.

              How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequences through the use of a deep learning architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer–promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret

              Background
              Due to the complexity of the biological systems, the prediction of the potential DNA binding sites for transcription factors remains a difficult problem in computational biology. Genomic DNA sequences and experimental results from parallel sequencing provide available information about the affinity and accessibility of genome and are commonly used features in binding sites prediction. The attention mechanism in deep learning has shown its capability to learn long-range dependencies from sequential data, such as sentences and voices. Until now, no study has applied this approach in binding site inference from massively parallel sequencing data. The successful applications of attention mechanism in similar input contexts motivate us to build and test new methods that can accurately determine the binding sites of transcription factors.
            
            
              Results
              In this study, we propose a novel tool (named DeepGRN) for transcription factors binding site prediction based on the combination of two components: single attention module and pairwise attention module. The performance of our methods is evaluated on the ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge datasets. The results show that DeepGRN achieves higher unified scores in 6 of 13 targets than any of the top four methods in the DREAM challenge. We also demonstrate that the attention weights learned by the model are correlated with potential informative inputs, such as DNase-Seq coverage and motifs, which provide possible explanations for the predictive improvements in DeepGRN.
            
            
              Conclusions
              DeepGRN can automatically and effectively predict transcription factor binding sites from DNA sequences and DNase-Seq coverage. Furthermore, the visualization techniques we developed for the attention modules help to interpret how critical patterns from different types of input features are recognized by our model.},
