This thesis would not have been possible without the supervision, support, kindness and love I received from many people througout the years. 

First, my deepest gratitude belongs to Barbara, for giving me the opportunity to work on exciting topics with a bunch of amazing people. Your awe-inspiring compentence and admirable kindness made every discussion with you an uplifting and inspiring experience. A huge thanks also goes to Gray, your vision and passion for science sparks enthusiasm and reignited my motivation many times. Between the two of you, you assembled a team of excellent scientists and created a space buzzing with inovation. It was just a blast to work with every single one in the TreutCamp ensemble, thanks to all of you! Particularly I want to thank FÃ¡tima, Sophie and Fides, the main co-authors of the studies presented here. All three of you tought me so much and quite literally none of this would have been possible without your experimental virtuosity. Moreover, this would not be complete without thanking Zhisong. I leaned quite a bit of new skills over the years and I feel like I owe a significant portion of this to your knowledge and experience.
